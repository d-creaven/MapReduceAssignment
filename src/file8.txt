I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free——
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

Before they came the air was calm enough,
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
They concentrate my attention, that was happy
Playing and resting without committing itself.

The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
And comes from a country far away as health.
I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.

Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
         Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
         Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
         The place of fame and elegy supply:
And many a holy text around she strews,
         That teach the rustic moralist to die.

For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
         This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
         Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
         Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
         Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead
         Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
         Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
         "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
         To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

"There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
         That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
         And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
         Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
         Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

"One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
         Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
         Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

"The next with dirges due in sad array
         Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
         Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

THE EPITAPH
Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
       A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
       And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
       Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
       He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

No farther seek his merits to disclose,
       Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose)
       The bosom of his Father and his God.

       I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
       To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
       How free it is, you have no idea how free——
       The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
       And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
       It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
       Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

       The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
       Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
       Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
       Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
       They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
       Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
       A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

       Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
       The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
       Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
       And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
       Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
       And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
       The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

       Before they came the air was calm enough,
       Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
       Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
       Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
       Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
       They concentrate my attention, that was happy
       Playing and resting without committing itself.

       The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
       The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
       They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
       And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
       Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
       The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
       And comes from a country far away as health.

       The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

       Before they came the air was calm enough,
       Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
       Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
       Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
       Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
       They concentrate my attention, that was happy
       Playing and resting without committing itself.

       The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
       The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
       They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
       And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
       Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
       The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
       And comes from a country far away as health.
       I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
       To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
       How free it is, you have no idea how free——
       The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
       And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
       It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
       Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

       The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
       Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
       Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
       Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
       They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
       Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
       A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

       Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
       The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
       Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
       And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
       Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
       And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
       The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

       Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
                Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
       With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
                Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

       Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
                The place of fame and elegy supply:
       And many a holy text around she strews,
                That teach the rustic moralist to die.

       For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
                This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
       Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
                Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

       On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
                Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
       Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
                Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

       For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead
                Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
       If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
                Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

       Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
                "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
       Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
                To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

       "There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
                That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
       His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
                And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

       "Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
                Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
       Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
                Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

       "One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
                Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
       Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
                Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

       "The next with dirges due in sad array
                Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
       Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
                Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

       THE EPITAPH
       Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
              A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
       Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
              And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

       Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
              Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
       He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
              He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

       No farther seek his merits to disclose,
              Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
       (There they alike in trembling hope repose)
              The bosom of his Father and his God.

       THE EPITAPH
       Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
              A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
       Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
              And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

       Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
              Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
       He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
              He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

       No farther seek his merits to disclose,
              Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
       (There they alike in trembling hope repose)
              The bosom of his Father and his God.


I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free——
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

Before they came the air was calm enough,
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
They concentrate my attention, that was happy
Playing and resting without committing itself.

The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
And comes from a country far away as health.
I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.

Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
         Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
         Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
         The place of fame and elegy supply:
And many a holy text around she strews,
         That teach the rustic moralist to die.

For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
         This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
         Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

         Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
         Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

       A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

       Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
       The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
       Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
       And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
       Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
       And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
       The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

       Before they came the air was calm enough,
       Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
       Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
       Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
       Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
       They concentrate my attention, that was happy
       Playing and resting without committing itself.

       The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
       The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
       They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
       And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
       Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
       The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
       And comes from a country far away as health.
       I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
       To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
       How free it is, you have no idea how free——
       The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
       And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
       It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
       Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

       The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
       Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
       Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
       Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
       They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,

       Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
                Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
       With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
                Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

       Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
                The place of fame and elegy supply:
       And many a holy text around she strews,
                That teach the rustic moralist to die.

       For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
                This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
       Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,

       On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
                Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
       Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
                Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

       For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead
                Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
       If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
                Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

       Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
                "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
       Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
                To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

       "There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
                That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
       His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
                And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

       "Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
                Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
       Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
                Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

       "One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
                Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
       Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
                Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

       "The next with dirges due in sad array
                Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
       Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
                Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

       THE EPITAPH
       Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
              A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
       Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
              And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

       Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
              Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
       He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
              He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

       No farther seek his merits to disclose,
              Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
       (There they alike in trembling hope repose)
              The bosom of his Father and his God.

                Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

       "The next with dirges due in sad array
                Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
       Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
                Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

       THE EPITAPH
       Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
              A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
       Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
              And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

       Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
              Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
       He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
              He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

       No farther seek his merits to disclose,
              Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
       (There they alike in trembling hope repose)
              The bosom of his Father and his God.

       Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
                Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
       With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
                Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

       Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
                The place of fame and elegy supply:
       And many a holy text around she strews,
                That teach the rustic moralist to die.

       For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
                This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
       Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
                Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

       On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
                Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
       Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
                Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

       For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead
                Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
       If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
                Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

                "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
       Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
                To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

       "There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
                That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
       His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
                And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

       "Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
                Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
       Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
                Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

       "One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,

I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free——
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

Before they came the air was calm enough,
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
They concentrate my attention, that was happy
Playing and resting without committing itself.

The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
And comes from a country far away as health.
I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free——

If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
         Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
         "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
         To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

"There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
         That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
         And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
         Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
         Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

"One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
         Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
         Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

"The next with dirges due in sad array
         Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
         Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

THE EPITAPH
Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
       A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
       And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
       Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
       He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

No farther seek his merits to disclose,
       Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose)
       The bosom of his Father and his God.
       I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
       To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
       How free it is, you have no idea how free——
       The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
       And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
       It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
       Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

       The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
       Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
       Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
       Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
       They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
       Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
       A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

       Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
       The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
       Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
       And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
       Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
       And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
       The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

       Before they came the air was calm enough,
       Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
       Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
       Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
       Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
       They concentrate my attention, that was happy
       Playing and resting without committing itself.

       The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
       The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
       They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
       And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
       Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
       The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
       And comes from a country far away as health.
       I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
       To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.

       For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
                This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,

       Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
                Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
       With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
                Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

       Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
                The place of fame and elegy supply:
       And many a holy text around she strews,
                That teach the rustic moralist to die.

       For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
                This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
       Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
                Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

       On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
                Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
       Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
                Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

       For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead
                Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
       If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
                Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

       Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
                "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
       Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
                To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

       "There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
                That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
       His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
                And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

       "Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
                Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
       Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
                Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

       "One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
                Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
       Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
                Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

       "The next with dirges due in sad array
                Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
       Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
                Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

       THE EPITAPH
       Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
              A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
       Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
              And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

       Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
              Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
       He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
              He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

       No farther seek his merits to disclose,
              Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,

I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free——
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

Before they came the air was calm enough,
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
They concentrate my attention, that was happy
Playing and resting without committing itself.

The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
And comes from a country far away as health.
I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free——

Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
         To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

"There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
         That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
         And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
         Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
         Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

"One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
         Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
         Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

"The next with dirges due in sad array
         Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
         Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

THE EPITAPH
Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
       A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
       And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
       Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
       He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

No farther seek his merits to disclose,
       Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose)
       The bosom of his Father and his God.

Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
         Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
         Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
         The place of fame and elegy supply:
And many a holy text around she strews,
         That teach the rustic moralist to die.

For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
         This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
         Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
         Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
         Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead
         Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
         Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

       I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
       To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
       How free it is, you have no idea how free——
       The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
       And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
       It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
       Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

       The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
       Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
       Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
       Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
       They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
       Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
       A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

       Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
       The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
       Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
       And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
       Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
       And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
       The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

       Before they came the air was calm enough,
       Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
       Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
       Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
       Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
       They concentrate my attention, that was happy
       Playing and resting without committing itself.

       The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
       The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
       They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
       And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
       Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
       The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
       And comes from a country far away as health.

       If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
                Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

       Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
                "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
       Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
                To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

       "There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
                That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
       His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
                And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

       "Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
                Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
       Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
                Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

       "One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
                Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
       Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
                Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

       "The next with dirges due in sad array
                Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
       Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
                Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

       THE EPITAPH
       Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
              A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
       Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
              And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

       Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
              Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
       He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
              He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

       No farther seek his merits to disclose,
              Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
       (There they alike in trembling hope repose)
              The bosom of his Father and his God.

       Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
                Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
       With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
                Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

       Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
                The place of fame and elegy supply:
       And many a holy text around she strews,
                That teach the rustic moralist to die.

       For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
                This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
       Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
                Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

       On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
                Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
       Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
                Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free——
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

Before they came the air was calm enough,
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
They concentrate my attention, that was happy
Playing and resting without committing itself.

The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
And comes from a country far away as health.
I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free——
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.

His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
         And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
         Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
         Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

"One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
         Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
         Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

"The next with dirges due in sad array
         Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
         Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

THE EPITAPH
Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
       A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
       And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
       Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
       He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

No farther seek his merits to disclose,
       Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
(There they alike in trembling hope repose)
       The bosom of his Father and his God.

Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
         Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
         Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
         The place of fame and elegy supply:
And many a holy text around she strews,
         That teach the rustic moralist to die.

For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
         This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
         Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
         Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
         Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead
         Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
         Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
         "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
         To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

       I didn’t want any flowers, I only wanted
       To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
       How free it is, you have no idea how free——
       The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
       And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
       It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
       Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

       The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
       Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
       Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
       Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
       They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
       Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
       A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

       Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
       The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
       Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
       And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
       Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
       And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
       The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

       Before they came the air was calm enough,
       Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
       Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
       Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
       Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
       They concentrate my attention, that was happy
       Playing and resting without committing itself.

       The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
       The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
       They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
       And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
       Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
       The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
       And comes from a country far away as health.

                Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;

       "The next with dirges due in sad array
                Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.
       Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
                Grav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."

       THE EPITAPH
       Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
              A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
       Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,
              And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.

       Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
              Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
       He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
              He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.

       No farther seek his merits to disclose,
              Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,
       (There they alike in trembling hope repose)
              The bosom of his Father and his God.

       Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect,
                Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
       With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
                Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.

       Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd muse,
                The place of fame and elegy supply:
       And many a holy text around she strews,
                That teach the rustic moralist to die.

       For who to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
                This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
       Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
                Nor cast one longing, ling'ring look behind?

       On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
                Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
       Ev'n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
                Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires.

       For thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead
                Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
       If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
                Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,

       Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
                "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
       Brushing with hasty steps the dews away
                To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.

       "There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
                That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
       His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
                And pore upon the brook that babbles by.

       "Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
                Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,
       Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
                Or craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.

       "One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
                Along the heath and near his fav'rite tree;
       Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
                Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;
